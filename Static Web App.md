Description - A web application that can be delivered to a user's browser without server-side changes to its HTML, CSS, or JavaScript content.

My interpretation - serve static css, html and javascript.

Additional info - The content is hard-coded in HTML and CSS, and does not require scripting or pre-processing to fill the page with dynamic content.
Additional info - Static web apps can still contain interactivity.
